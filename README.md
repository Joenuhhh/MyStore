Introduction:
This README provides an overview of the Ecommerce Application, a Spring Boot-based project hosted on Azure. The application demonstrates CRUD operations, login functionality, and search features. It is designed to simulate an online store selling computer hardware components.

Features:

CRUD Operations: Users can perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on computer hardware components. This includes adding new components, viewing existing ones, updating details such as price and quantity, and removing components from the inventory.

Login Functionality: The application provides secure user authentication, allowing registered users to log in securely. This feature ensures that only authenticated users can access certain functionalities, such as updating inventory or viewing personalized information.

Search Functionality: Users can search for specific hardware components based on various criteria such as name, category, price range, etc. The search feature enhances the user experience by enabling quick and efficient navigation through the inventory.

Deployment:
The application is deployed on Azure, utilizing Azure App Service for hosting the Spring Boot application. Additionally, a SQL database hosted on Azure is integrated with the application to store and manage data related to hardware components.

Technologies Used:

Spring Boot: The backend of the application is developed using the Spring Boot framework, providing a robust and scalable foundation for building enterprise-grade applications.
Azure: The application is hosted on the Azure cloud platform, leveraging services such as Azure App Service for deployment and Azure SQL Database for data storage.
SQL Database: Azure SQL Database is used to store and manage data related to computer hardware components, including details such as price and quantity.
Java: The application is primarily developed in Java, leveraging its versatility and performance for backend development.
HTML/CSS/JavaScript: Frontend components of the application are developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, providing a responsive and interactive user interface.
Usage:
To access the Ecommerce Application, navigate to the deployed URL on Azure. Upon accessing the application, users can register/login to their accounts, browse the inventory of computer hardware components, perform CRUD operations, and utilize the search functionality to find specific items.
